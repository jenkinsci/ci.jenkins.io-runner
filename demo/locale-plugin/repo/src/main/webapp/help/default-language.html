<div>
    Specifies the default language of Jenkins. This is used for messages
    that Jenkins produces during builds, as well as the default choice
    of the UI language when the browser didn't specify its preference.

    <p>
    Internally, this uses <tt>Locale.setDefault()</tt>, so this affects
    all the other web applications that are running in the same container.
